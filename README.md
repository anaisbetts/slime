## SLIME for Atom

This is a plugin that lets you send code to a REPL of your choosing. This can
be a Rails console, a node.js session, or any other environment that you want.
This allows you to write code in your editor, while seeing if your code works
as you write it, instead of trying to debug it all at the end.
